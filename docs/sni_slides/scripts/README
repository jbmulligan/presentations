Notes on launching scripts from the browser.

On linux, firefox can specify /bin/csh to interpret script files,
but on the mac, the helper applications has to be a .app bundle!?

This is solved using a system tool called the Automator, an app
called run_csh is created that runs the following commands using /bin/bash:

echo $1 > /tmp/run_csh_file
/bin/csh -c $1


The .app bundle is placed in $HOME/scripts (which must be in the $PATH).
