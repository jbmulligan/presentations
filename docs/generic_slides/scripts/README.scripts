Getting a local shell script to run from a browser link is a bit tricky.
The browser has to be configured to perform a specific action on the filetype
(I have used .csh).  I should have documented this better, but I believe
I created an app called run_script using the Mac's Automator, it is passed the
path the the script that we want to run.
