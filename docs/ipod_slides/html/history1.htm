		  John Robson remembers:
		  <br><br>
		  Fergus Campbell and I started looking at contrast sensitivity in 1962; we looked at ordinary gratings on a regular CRT oscilloscope with a 6 inch tube. The results of our early observations were presented at a symposium at Brown in January 1964 organised by Lorrin Riggs. For some reason Fergus didn't want to go (maybe he knew how cold it would be) and I went and presented our paper (attachment 1). To the extent that this is a publication, it is the first one. William Rushton was the discussant and he started by drawing some wiggly lines on a blackboard that was there.

		  Said he had enjoyed my talk but found it more understandable when he realised that the sinusoidal gratings I had been talking about were not just bunches of wiggly lines. We decided that for our next presentation we should have a picture of a grating.
